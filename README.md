Simple weather application
The Weather App provides weather information for any user-entered US city, along with location-based weather retrieval (if location permissions are granted). 
The app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays relevant information such as temperature, weather description, and weather icons. 
It also caches the last searched city to improve the user experience by displaying it on the app launch. 
The app is built using Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, and MVVM architecture for clean code separation.
